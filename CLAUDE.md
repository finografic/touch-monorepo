# Claude-specific Instructions

## Rules — Claude

- IMPORTANT: NEVER include `Co-Authored-By` lines in commit messages.

## Session Memory

Claude Code maintains a lightweight session log at `.claude/memory.md` (gitignored).

**On session start:** Read `.claude/memory.md` if it exists. Use it to understand recent context. If a `## Current Session` block exists, a previous session ended abruptly — resume or finish that work first.

**On task start:** Write a `## Current Session` block at the top of the file with:

- Date
- Brief description of the task
- A checklist of planned steps (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`)

Update the checklist as work progresses (check off items, add new ones if scope changes).

**On session end (or after significant work):** Collapse the `## Current Session` block into a normal `## <date>` entry (a 2-4 line summary), and move it below the previous sessions. Keep only the **last 5 session entries** (delete older ones when appending).

Keep only the **last 5 sessions** in the file (delete older entries when appending). Each entry should be 2-4 lines max — this is a breadcrumb trail, not a journal.

## Handoff Document

Claude Code maintains a handoff document at `.claude/handoff.md` (gitignored).

Bridges context between Claude Code (local) and Claude.ai (no repo access). The developer
uploads it manually to Claude.ai for continuity.

**When to update:** After any session that changes architecture, adds/removes commands/features,
resolves open questions, or shifts priorities. Not every session.

**Rules:**

- Update only the sections that changed. Keep the file under 150 lines.
- Write in present tense. No code snippets — describe what exists, not how.
- `memory.md` = session work log. `handoff.md` = project state snapshot. Don't duplicate.
