# Breakpoints

## Active Scale

We use the **Panda CSS / Tailwind CSS default breakpoint scale**, which is also
the scale used by Park UI (the official Ark UI + Panda CSS design system).

| Key   | px     | rem   | Notes                          |
| ----- | ------ | ----- | ------------------------------ |
| `xs`  | `0`    | `0`   | Base / mobile-first default    |
| `sm`  | `640`  | `40`  |                                |
| `md`  | `768`  | `48`  |                                |
| `lg`  | `1024` | `64`  |                                |
| `xl`  | `1280` | `80`  |                                |
| `2xl` | `1536` | `96`  |                                |

`xs: 0` is included for completeness and type completeness but is rarely queried
directly — mobile-first design starts from zero by default.

## Reference: Other Scales

### Tailwind CSS / Panda CSS defaults ← active

```
xs:    0   sm: 640   md: 768   lg: 1024   xl: 1280   2xl: 1536
```

- Panda CSS ships these as its default theme breakpoints (`@pandacss/preset-panda`)
- Park UI uses these values directly
- `xs` is not included in Panda defaults; we add it at `0`

### Radix UI Themes

```
xs:    0   sm: 520   md: 768   lg: 1024   xl: 1280   2xl: 1640
```

- Used by `@radix-ui/themes`
- **V1 client (`apps/client/src/styles/`) was built on this scale**
- Key differences vs active: `sm` is 120px narrower (520 vs 640), `2xl` is 104px wider (1640 vs 1536)

### Previous design-system values (before this change)

```
xs:    0   sm: 520   md: 768   lg: 1024   xl: 1280   2xl: 1640
```

Matched the Radix UI scale. Changed to Panda/TW defaults for alignment with
Panda CSS tooling and Park UI documentation.

## Why Panda CSS defaults?

- **Ark UI is fully headless** — `@ark-ui/react` defines zero breakpoints.
  It provides state machines and accessibility behaviour only; all styling
  (including breakpoints) is the responsibility of the styling layer.
- **Panda CSS defers to the preset** — our `designSystemPreset` sets
  `extend.breakpoints: BREAKPOINTS_PX`, which overrides Panda's defaults.
  There is no mismatch risk.
- **Park UI alignment** — Park UI (the reference Ark UI + Panda design system,
  not installed but used as a patterns reference) uses Panda defaults. Using
  the same scale means code examples and recipes from Park UI docs transfer
  directly without mental translation.
- **`sm: 640` vs `sm: 520`** — the 120px gap matters during V1 → V2 migration.
  Any V1 styles that relied on `sm: 520` targeting phone-landscape / small-tablet
  will need to be reviewed. This is expected breakage; document in the migration guide.

## Where breakpoints are consumed

Breakpoints surface in three ways in this system:

### 1. Panda CSS responsive utilities

Any token or utility value can be made responsive using object or array syntax:

```ts
// Object syntax — key names must match BREAKPOINTS keys
css({ fontSize: { base: 'sm', md: 'lg', xl: 'xl' } })

// Array syntax — maps left-to-right to [base, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl]
css({ display: ['flex', null, 'grid'] })
```

### 2. Component recipes (responsive size props)

Ark UI wrappers accept responsive Panda values for `size`, `variant`, etc.:

```tsx
<Button size={{ base: 'sm', md: 'md' }}>Submit</Button>
```

Prominent components where this is relevant:

- **Button** — `size` prop (sm/md/lg) typically shifts at `md`
- **Dialog / Drawer** — width and placement flip at `md`
- **Select / Menu** _(planned)_ — dropdown anchoring changes at `md`
- **Tabs** _(planned)_ — horizontal vs stacked layout at `sm`
- **Typography recipes** _(planned)_ — fluid heading sizes at `md`, `lg`
- **Layout tokens** _(planned)_ — sidebar collapse at `lg`, nav at `md`

### 3. CSS-in-JS helpers (Emotion, during V1 → V2 transition)

The `min` and `max` exports from `viewport.emotion.ts` produce `@media` strings
for direct use in Emotion `css()` calls in the client during the migration period:

```ts
import { min } from '@workspace/design-system/viewport';

const styles = css`
  padding: 1rem;
  ${min.md} { padding: 2rem; }
`;
```

## Exports from this module

```ts
import {
  BREAKPOINTS,        // Record<ScreenClass, number> — numeric px values
  BREAKPOINTS_PX,     // Record<ScreenClass, string> — '640px' etc. (Panda config)
  BREAKPOINTS_REM,    // Record<ScreenClass, number> — rem equivalents
  BREAKPOINTS_EM,     // Record<ScreenClass, number> — em equivalents
  BREAKPOINT_VALUES,  // number[]                    — values excluding xs:0
  QUERIES_MIN,        // Record<ScreenClass, string> — '(min-width: Xpx)'
  QUERIES_MAX,        // Omit<Record<ScreenClass, string>, 'xs'>
  MEDIA_QUERIES,      // { min, max } — partial maps
  min,                // Record<ScreenClass, string> — '@media (min-width: Xpx)'
  max,                // Record<ScreenClass, string> — '@media (max-width: Xpx)'
  sizes,              // ScreenClass[]
} from '@workspace/design-system';
```
